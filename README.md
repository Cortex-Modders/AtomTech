AtomTech
==================
made for Modjam August 2013 by EnderShadow and Jadar.


###About
AtomTech is a mod based around the pereodic table. You have to research different elements and work your way to the top. 

####Analizing Elements
There are 3 teirs of anazizers planned. The first one is the most basic, and requires the least to use. It only gathers basic information about elements. I.e. Name, symbol, and atomic number. The second is gathers more informationm, i.e. mass number, but as a result is more slow at its job. The third will gather information on the radioactivity and go even slower.

####Analizer Controller
You can't just use the Analizer by itself, you need a controller. AtomTech adds a *Laptop* that is used as the controller. Information is stored on a flash drive which is what makes it unique to a player. Also, it means you can share data between players. Be careful not to step on it, as you could damage the laptop.

####Aethestic Gear
AtomTech adds several new aesthetic items, such as lab coats, etc.

####More to come!
We have more planned! But the plans aren't finalized quite yet. Stay tuned! Follow @Jadardev on Twitter for updates when he is livestreaming on Twitch.tv.
